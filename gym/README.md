# How to set up the environment and train the model

## 1) pull the the repository
## 2) cd to gym folder
## 3) execute "make build", to build a docker image named coral-ai, please do not wanna bet the smart one to change the name of the docker image
## 4) execute "make registry", to registry the docker image on registry.fsoc.hpi.uni-potsdam.de, do it even if you do not understand why
## 5) execute "make run", to run the docker container that will train, export the trained model and evaluate it

## the "make clean" will clean up images and stoped containers, why? well, you will need it when you are run out of space trust me I am an enginner ...
