### PROBLEM: ValueError: Duplicate plugins for name projector terminate called without an active exception


### Suggestion: Fix conflicting installations

Conflicting package installations found. Depending on the order of
installations and uninstallations, behavior may be undefined. Please
uninstall ALL versions of TensorFlow and TensorBoard, then reinstall
ONLY the desired version of TensorFlow, which will transitively pull
in the proper version of TensorBoard. (If you use TensorBoard without
TensorFlow, just reinstall the appropriate version of TensorBoard
directly.)

Namely:

	pip uninstall tb-nightly tensorboard tensorflow-estimator tensorflow-gpu tf-estimator-nightly
	pip install tensorflow  # or `tensorflow-gpu`, or `tf-nightly`, ...
